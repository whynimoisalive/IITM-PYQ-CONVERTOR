# Automatic Question Paper Ticks and Cross Remover


## Overview

The **Automatic Question Paper Ticks and Cross Remover** is a simple Windows application designed to help IITM students clean up their previous year question papers. This application automatically removes ticks and crosses from the PDF, converts the PDF to black and white if needed, and ensures that the processed PDF opens in the Edge browser's PDF viewer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your default PDF viewer is set to the Edge browser's PDF viewer.

### HOW TO USE IT?(For begginers who cant run the python code)

1. **Download the Executable**: Running the executable will **trigger a Windows protection warning because the app isn't registered.** To bypass this warning, click "More info" and then select "Run anyway." <a href="https://mega.nz/file/Eq8DHLQK#qrXKtKuAtjqwm-fDs6K10JNHTEJ9PfqkdE6eqw56A7Q" target="_blank">Download Link to EXE</a>

### How It Works
